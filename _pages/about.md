I am a Research Scientist at the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences
at the University of Washington where I work with [Patricia Kuhl](http://ilabs.uw.edu/institute-faculty/bio/i-labs-patricia-k-kuhl-phd)
in the Department of Speech & Hearing Sciences. My research focuses on the
neurobiological basis of speech and auditory language function
using [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography)
to characterize brain activity during language function in populations between
infancy and adulthood.


Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Radiology at the
[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](http://www.chop.edu/treatments/magnetoencephalography-meg-scan),
where I used MEG to study abnormal brain function during spoken word recognition
in children with Autism. I received my PhD cognitive psychology at the
[Institute for Biomagnetism and Biosignal Analysis](https://campus.uni-muenster.de/biomag/startseite/) in
Muesnter Germany with Dr. Christo Pantev.
