I am a scientist with over ten years of experience in research and development in [academia](https://tinyurl.com/yxhmdbfj). Currently I am a research engineer at the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences at the University of Washington where I work with [Patricia Kuhl](http://ilabs.uw.edu/institute-faculty/bio/i-labs-patricia-k-kuhl-phd). My research focuses on language cognition and speech perception using [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography) to characterize the timing and spatial organization of brain activity during language function in human populations.

Before relocating to Seattle Washington I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Radiology at the [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](http://www.chop.edu/treatments/magnetoencephalography-meg-scan), where I used MEG to study language impairment in young children with Autism. I received my Ms.C. in cognitive psychology at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu) and went on to earn my Ph.D. with Prof. Dr. Christo Pantev at the [Institute for Biomagnetism and Biosignal Analysis](https://campus.uni-muenster.de/biomag/startseite/) in MÃ¼nster Germany.
